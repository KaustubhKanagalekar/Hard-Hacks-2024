**Brainstorm Idea**

Propose a haptic band designed to offer directional guidance through haptic feedback and/or lights. This innovation aims to enable users to remain attentive to their surroundings without the need to constantly refer to their phones for navigation, thus serving as a reliable backup in case of a low phone battery.
- Activation occurs by swinging the arm equipped with the gadget.
- Explore the feasibility of incorporating functionality for both arms to provide directional feedback for both left and right swings.
- Consider prioritizing vibration over LED or alarm signals for improved user experience.
- Note the requirement for batteries to power the device.
- Explore alternative sensor options, such as camera, infrared, or webcam, considering size limitations and practicality.

*We decided to go for the Haptic Band because of the Enhanced Safety and Accessibility.*

**Project Development**

*Regrettably, due to the overwhelming number of participants in the event, our group faces equipment shortages. In response, we've decided to pivot our project while maintaining our core objective: ensuring individuals feel safe, particularly when alone at night.*

We have to change the course of our project with the same intention of helping a person feel safe at night by considering the safety of the person when alone at midnight.

The new device that we came up with is a gadget that can detect the surroundings mainly using HC-SR04 Distance Sensor.

**Features:**
Detect surrounding 
Give vibration to the user
The vibration will tell directions to the user

**The equipment (What we plan to use right now):**
- Arduino Uno
- Sonar
- Buzz
- LEDs

**Step by Steps**
1. We test the circuit with only LEDs light with the Arduino Uno.
2. We add a Buzz sound with the button that allows us to determine whether the light and buzz to light and sound.
3. Then we end our project by replacing the button with the sonar that will detect the person or anything that comes near the user.

**Limitations/challenges:**
1. The lacking of the equiments.
2. The quality of the sonar is not good enough to do what we expected (2 cm to 400 cm).
3. The Buzz sound is too quiet and the light is not bright enough.

**Future development**
1. Improving HC-SR04 Distance Sensor Accuracy with DHT22 Temperature Sensor
