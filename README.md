# Hard-Hack-2024

Brainstorm Idea
Haptic band that will provide directions (via haptic and/or lights). This will allow the user to pay attention to their surroundings instead of glancing at their phone for directions (also works as a backup if phone battery dies)
Works when you swing the arm with the gadget
What about both arms, so when we swing it works both left and right?
Instead of LED or alarm, vibration may work better
Need batteries to run
Camera, infrared, webcam(Too big)
