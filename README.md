# Hard-Hack-2024

**Brainstorm Idea**
Haptic band that will provide directions (via haptic and/or lights). This will allow the user to pay attention to their surroundings instead of glancing at their phone for directions (also works as a backup if phone battery dies)
Works when you swing the arm with the gadget
What about both arms, so when we swing it works both left and right?
Instead of LED or alarm, vibration may work better
Need batteries to run
Camera, infrared, webcam(Too big)
I move to below as we chose this as real project
Or 
Belt with sensor(haptic and/or light) in four directions. (Size and how)
The alternative of Belt: Backpack
Equipment: Sonar, Temp sensor, Webcam, 
How: Notification on Phone, Alarm

We decide to go for the Haptic Band because of the Nobel reason.

**Development of the project**
Unfortunately, Our group Lacking the equipment since there are too many people in the event expected.

We have to change the course of our project with the same intention of helping a person feel safe at night by considering the safety of the person when alone at midnight.

Our new device that we came up is the gadget can detect the surrounding.

**Features:**
Detect surrounding 
Give vibration to the user
The vibration will tell directions to the user

**The equipment (What we plan to use right now):**
- Arduino Uno
- Sonar
- Buzz
- LEDs

**Step by Steps**
1. We test the circuit with only LEDs light with the Arduino Uno.
2. We add Buzz sound with the button that allow us to determind whether the light and buzz to light and sound.
3. Then we end our project with replace the button with the sonar that will detect the person or anything that come near the user.

**Limitations/challenges:**
1. The lacking of the equiments.
2. The quailty of the sonar is not good enough to do what we expected (2 cm to 400 cm).
3. The Buzz sound is too quiet and the light is not bright enough.

**Future developement**
1. Improving HC-SR04 Distance Sensor Accuracy with DHT22 Temperature Sensor
